                        Awesome. Thanks for reaching out to me.
                            Let’s jump into Rust by working through a hands-on project together! you’ll practice the fundamentals.

                            We’ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Here’s how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.
